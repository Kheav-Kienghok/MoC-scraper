# Conclusion!


## How to Run the Application

```bash
python main.py
```

I wanted to scrape all possible news links from [https://uat.moc.gov.kh](https://uat.moc.gov.kh).  
To achieve this, I created `DynamicLinkScrapping.py`, a script that scrolls through the website's infinite scroll and collects all news links.  
The scraping process takes approximately 6 minutes to complete. After manually inputting the URLs into `main.py`, the processing takes about 28.57 seconds.  
The total time for the entire process is approximately 428.57 seconds.

Using the brute force method, the processing time is 35.46 seconds.
